    - [React Native 0.75+](https://github.com/facebook/react-native)
    - [React 18.1+](https://github.com/facebook/react)

    _UI Components require additional peer dependencies_
    - [React Navigation 6+](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation)
    - [React Native Safe Area Context 4+](https://github.com/th3rdwave/react-native-safe-area-context)
    - [React Native Vector Icons 10+](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons)
    - [React Native WebView 13+](https://github.com/react-native-webview/react-native-webview)

- **iOS**
    - Xcode 12+
    - [Deployment target 13.4+](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/deve69552ee5)
    - [Iterable's iOS SDK](https://github.com/Iterable/iterable-swift-sdk)

- **Android**
    - [`minSdkVersion` 21+, `compileSdkVersion` 31+](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/picking-your-compilesdkversion-minsdkversion-targetsdkversion-a098a0341ebd)
    - [Iterable's Android SDK](https://github.com/Iterable/iterable-android-sdk)

## Installation

For installation instructions, read [Installing Iterable's React Native SDK](https://support.iterable.com/hc/articles/360045714132).

## ðŸ“š API Documentation

View the [API documentation](https://iterable-react-native-sdk.netlify.app).

## Architecture Support

**Important**: Iterable's React Native SDK has limited support for [React
Native's New Architecture](https://reactnative.dev/architecture/landing-page)
through interop. We are in the process of updating the SDK to fully support the New
Architecture, and suggest using the legacy architecture in the meantime.  *TLDR;* Use the New Architecture at your own risk --
you may encounter significant issues.
