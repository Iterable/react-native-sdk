  /**
   * A function expression that provides a valid JWT for the app's current user

   *
   * Provide an implementation for this method only if your app uses a
   * [JWT-enabled API
   * key](https://support.iterable.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045714132-Installing-Iterable-s-React-Native-SDK#:~:text=app%20uses%20a-,JWT%2Denabled%20API%20key,-.).
   *
   * @remarks
   * To make requests to Iterable's API using a JWT-enabled API key, you should
   * first fetch a valid JWT for your app's current user from your own server,
   * which must generate it. The `authHandler` provides this JWT to Iterable's
   * React Native SDK, which can then append the JWT to subsequent API requests.
   * The SDK automatically calls `authHandler` at various times:
   * - When your app sets the user's email or user ID.
   * - When your app updates the user's email.
   * - Before the current JWT expires (at a configurable interval set by
   *   `expiringAuthTokenRefreshPeriod`)
   * - When your app receives a 401 response from Iterable's API with a
   *   `InvalidJwtPayload` error code. However, if the SDK receives a second
   *   consecutive 401 with an `InvalidJwtPayload` error when it makes a request
   *   with the new token, it won't call the `authHandler` again until you call
   *   `setEmail` or `setUserId` without passing in an auth token.
   *
   * **TIP**: The `setEmail` and `setUserId` mobile SDK methods accept an
   * optional, prefetched auth token. If you encounter SDK errors related to
   * auth token requests, try using this parameter.
   *
   * For more information about JWT-enabled API keys, read [JWT-Enabled API Keys](https://support.iterable.com/hc/articles/360050801231).
   *
   *  @example
   * This example demonstrates how an app that uses a JWT-enabled API key might initialize the SDK.
   *
   * ```typescript
   * const config = new IterableConfig();
   *
   * config.authHandler = () => {
   *  // ... Fetch a JWT from your server, or locate one you've already retrieved
   *  return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
   *    // Resolve the promise with a valid auth token for the current user
   *    resolve("<AUTH_TOKEN>")
   *  });
   * };
   * config.autoPushRegistration = false;
   *
   * Iterable.initialize('<YOUR_API_KEY>', config);
   * ```
   *
   * @returns A promise that resolves to an `IterableAuthResponse`, a `string`,
   * or `undefined`.
