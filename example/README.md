This is the Iterable React Native Example App, bootstrapped using
[`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

Use this to understand how you can use Iterables React Native SDK in your own
React Native application.

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment
>Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) instructions till
>"Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Install dependencies
To install the app dependencies, run the following command from the
_example app directory_ (the directory in which this document resides):

```bash
yarn install
```

Once this is done, you will need to install the pods in the _ios_ folder in the
_example app directory_.  To do so, run the following:

```bash
cd ios
pod install
```

Once this is done, `cd` back into the _example app directory_:

```bash
cd ..
```

## Step 2: Add your environment variables
In the _example app directory_, there is a file called **.env.example**.  Make a
copy of this file, name it **.env** and place it in the exampe app directory.

In it, you will find:

```shell
ITBL_API_KEY=replace_this_with_your_iterable_api_key
ITBL_ID=replace_this_with_your_user_id_or_email
```

Replace `replace_this_with_your_iterable_api_key` with your _mobile_ Iterable API key,
and replace `replace_this_with_your_user_id_or_email` with the email or user id
that you use to log into Iterable.

Follow the steps below if you do not have a mobile Iterable API key.

### Adding an API Key
To add an API key, do the following:
 1. Sign into your Iterable account
 2. Go to [Integrations > API Keys](https://app.iterable.com/settings/apiKeys)
 3. Click "New API Key" in the top right corner
 4. Fill in the followsing fields:
    - Name: A descriptive name for the API key
    - Type: Mobile
    - JWT authentication: Leave **unchecked** (IMPORTANT)
 5. Click "Create API Key"
 6. Copy the generated API key


## Step 3: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
yarn start
```

## Step 4: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.


## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run the Iterable Example App. :partying_face:


# Troubleshooting

## Error: `Could not find gem 'cocoapods (>= 1.13, != 1.15.0, != 1.15.1)' in locally installed gems`

To fix, run the following in the _example app directory_:

```bash
bundle install
```

## Other
If things are not working and you are stumped as to why, try running the
following in the _example app directory_:

```bash
npx react-native doctor
```

This will give you information about what react native needs in order to run,
and whether it is accessible to the app.

Take a look at the OS you are trying to run.  Make sure that everything has been
installed and that the necessary items have been added to your `PATH`.
