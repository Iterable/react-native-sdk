This is the Iterable React Native Example App, bootstrapped using
[`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

Use this to understand how you can use Iterables React Native SDK in your own
React Native application.

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment
>Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) instructions till
>"Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Install dependencies
To install the app dependencies, run the following command from the
_example app directory_ (the directory in which this document resides):

```bash
yarn install
```

Once this is done, you will need to install the pods in the _ios_ folder in the
_example app directory_.  To do so, run the following:

```bash
cd ios
pod install
```

Once this is done, `cd` back into the _example app directory_:

```bash
cd ..
```

## Step 2: Add your environment variables
In the _example app directory_, there is a file called **.env.example**.  Make a
copy of this file, name it **.env** and place it in the example app directory.

In it, you will find:

```shell
ITBL_API_KEY=replace_this_with_your_iterable_api_key
ITBL_ID=replace_this_with_your_user_id_or_email
```

Replace `replace_this_with_your_iterable_api_key` with your _mobile_ Iterable API key,
and replace `replace_this_with_your_user_id_or_email` with the email or user id
that you use to log into Iterable.

Follow the steps below if you do not have a mobile Iterable API key.

### Adding an API Key
To add an API key, do the following:
 1. Sign into your Iterable account
 2. Go to [Integrations > API Keys](https://app.iterable.com/settings/apiKeys)
 3. Click "New API Key" in the top right corner
 4. Fill in the followsing fields:
    - Name: A descriptive name for the API key
    - Type: Mobile
    - JWT authentication: Leave **unchecked** (IMPORTANT)
 5. Click "Create API Key"
 6. Copy the generated API key


## Step 3: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _example app directory_:

```bash
yarn start
```

## Step 4: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _example app directory_. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
yarn ios
```

**NOTE**: If you are getting an error when running ios, make sure that *Xcode > Project Navigator > ReactNativeSdkExample > Build Settings > User
   Script Sandboxing* is set to **No**

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.


## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run the Iterable Example App. :partying_face:


# Troubleshooting

## Error: `Could not find gem 'cocoapods (>= 1.13, != 1.15.0, != 1.15.1)' in locally installed gems`

To fix, run the following in the _example app directory_:

```bash
bundle install
```

## Error: `Signing for 'ReactNativeSdkExample' requires a development team.  Select a development team in the Signing & Capabilities Editor`

- Open XCode
- Go to 'Signing & Capabilities'
- Choose a team
- Stop your application, then rerun

If you are still experiencing issues, try deleting `ios/.xcode.env.local`

## Error: `/Library/Ruby/Gems/XYZ does not have write permissions` or `/usr/local/lib does not have write permissions`

This is a common issue with using ruby on Macs.  You can modify the read/write
access of the computers Ruby folder, but a better (and safer) way is to use
`rbenv` and [`homebrew`](https://brew.sh/) by doing the following:

1. **Install/update homebrew**
If you have homebrew, update it by running: `brew update && brew upgrade`.
If you do not have homebrew, follow the [installation
instructions](https://brew.sh/).

2. **Install `rbenv` and `ruby-build`**
```bash
# Uninstall ruby (you can try skipping this step if you have concerns)
brew uninstall --ignore-dependencies ruby
# Install `rbenv` and `ruby-build`
brew install rbenv ruby-build
# Install the correct ruby version, eg: 3.3.6
rbenv install 3.3.6
# Default to using this ruby version
rbenv global 3.3.6
```

3. **Tell your computer to use `rbenv`**
Add the following to the top of your `.zshrc` or `.bash_profile`:
```zsh
eval "$(rbenv init -)"
```

4. **Reload `.zshrc` or `.bash_profile`**
Run the following in your terminal:
```bash
# If using zsh
source ~/.zshrc
# If using bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

5. **Check that the correct ruby version is loading**
Run the following in your terminal:
```bash
ruby --version
```
If working, it should say `3.3.6`

## Error: `bad interpreter: No such file or directory` on `pod install`
Reinstall cocoapods by doing the following:
```bash
# Uninstall current version of cocoapods
brew uninstall cocoapods
# Install a fresh version of cocoapods
brew install cocoapods
# Recreate link to cocoapods
brew unlink cocoapods && brew link cocoapods
```

Run `pod install` again, and it should work.

## Error: `com.android.builder.errors.EvalIssueException: SDK location not found.  Define a valid SDK location with an ANDROID_HOME environment variable or by setting the sdk.dir path in your projects local properties file`

This means that the project cannot find the location of your Android SDK.

There are two ways to fix this:

### 1. Add `ANDROID_HOME` to your *.zshrc* or *.bashrc* file.
1. Open your *.zshrc* or *.bashrc*
2. Add the following to the file:
   ```bash
   ANDROID_HOME=/path/to/Android/SDK # EG: ANDROID_HOME=/Users/My.Name/Library/Android/sdk
   ```

### 2. Add a *local.properties* file to *example/android*.
1. Go to *example/android*
2. Create a file called *local.properties*
3. In *local.properties*, add:
   ```bash
   sdk.dir=/path/to/Android/SDK # EG: sdk.dir=/Users/My.Name/Library/Android/sdk
   ```

## Error: `bundler: failed to load command: pod`
Run `bundle install` in the _example app directory_.  You can also try running
it in _ios_ in the _example app directory_.

## Error: `uninitialized constant ActiveSupport::LoggerThreadSafeLevel::Logger`

This is a known issue with Ruby 3.4.0.  You can fix it by running the following:
```bash
gem install xcodeproj -v '< 1.26.0'
gem install concurrent-ruby -v '< 1.3.4'
```

## Xcode 16.3 Issue

There is a [known issue](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/50411)
with Xcode 16.3 and react-native@0.75.3.

This SDK supports React Native New Architecture. If you encounter this Xcode-specific issue, consider downgrading Xcode to 16.2 or upgrading React Native once a fix is available.

## Other
If things are not working and you are stumped as to why, try running the
following in the _example app directory_:

```bash
npx react-native doctor
```

This will give you information about what react native needs in order to run,
and whether it is accessible to the app.

Take a look at the OS you are trying to run.  Make sure that everything has been
installed and that the necessary items have been added to your `PATH`.  Below
are example items that are commonly added to the *.zshrc* or *.bashrc*:

```zsh
# Load rbenv if using (suggested)
if which rbenv > /dev/null; then eval "$(rbenv init -)"; fi

# Load nvm if using (suggested)
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion

# General paths
export PATH=$HOME/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH
export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)/bin

# Homebrew setup
if [ -d "/opt/homebrew/bin" ]; then
    export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"
fi

# Android paths and variables
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=$ANDROID_HOME
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/homebrew/bin/gradle
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin

# Java variables
export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-17.jdk/Contents/Home

# Node variables and settings
export NODE_BINARY=node
export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
```

You should also look through the [React Native environment setup
docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) and make sure that
you did not miss anything.
